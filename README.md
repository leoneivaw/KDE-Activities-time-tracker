KDE Activities time tracker

Feel free to copy and improve the project.

I'm no longer working on it.


Tracks time spent on each KDE activity (KDE Activities). Time tracking for each activity works automatically, without the need for any action when switching between activities.
This is a working version, but there are still things to be done.
